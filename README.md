# Web-Scraping
Web scrapping job advertisements from Indeed

# Introduction
Web scrapping extracts web content, usually in the form of texture characters through looking at HTML. 
It is a skill ought to be possessed by one working on data-related projects. 
[Jesses Steinweg-Woods](https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/) wrote a post about extracting skills required by data scientist job advertisements on Indeed in 2015. 
Since then, Indeed has changed the layout of their website, it's no longer plain HTML, but requires some \"interactions\" with the javascript. 
Based on his idea, I wrote a code to enable the \"interactions\" and extract the job skills using just Selenium.
